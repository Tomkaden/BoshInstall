# BoshInstall
Install Bosh on AWS for Cloud Foundry

This is my attempt to get Bosh up and running on AWS so I can use Cloud Foundry to play with.
Ultimately for phase one I'd like multiple Bosh instances monitoring each other and installing Cloud Foundry.  Withing Cloud FOundry I'll run a test app based on Sinatra that responds to a basic http request.
